SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS name_length
FROM STATION
WHERE LENGTH(CITY) = (
    SELECT MIN(LENGTH(CITY))
    FROM STATION
)
UNION ALL
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS name_length
FROM STATION
WHERE LENGTH(CITY) = (
    SELECT MAX(LENGTH(CITY))
    FROM STATION
)
ORDER BY name_length desc, CITY limit 2;
