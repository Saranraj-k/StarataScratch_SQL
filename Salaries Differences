Tables: db_employee, db_dept

SELECT ABS(MAX(CASE WHEN d.department = 'marketing' THEN e.salary ELSE 0 END) -
           MAX(CASE WHEN d.department = 'engineering' THEN e.salary ELSE 0 END)) AS SalaryDifference
FROM db_employee e
JOIN db_dept d ON e.department_id=d.id
WHERE d.department IN ('marketing', 'engineering');
